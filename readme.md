#Finance Tracker HTML CSS JS
By Hayden Kong


Track your finance with this finance tracker. It uses local storage and has the ability to import and export CSV data. It visualises the data into stats, insights and interactive graphs and you can add your own catergories for easy managment. There is also a setting for Dark/Light mode depending on your preference. You can also set budget goals and/or limits.
